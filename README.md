# SPLUNK_ToolKit
Splunk ToolKit is multSplunk_Tool-Kit is a multiple python scripts that uses Splunk SDK Modules to automate the manual operational tasks of Creating Splunk Savedserches and Backfilling Summary Indexes. And that project is part of Data Pipeline Generalization Project.

As part of Data Pipeline on Splunk, It was required to create a massive number of savedsearches to feed a summary index with a metrics out of raw data index. That manually took much time to build it. Therefore i came up with the idea of using the Splunk SDK Modules to buid a toolkit that uses the metadata already collected to create the savedsearches automatically and afterwards bacckfilling the history data into the summary index.iple python scripts that ease the Splunk manual operations
